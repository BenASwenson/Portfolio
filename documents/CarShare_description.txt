Car Share 

Allow users around the world to share car journeys with each other.  Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PHP, MySQL, GoogleMaps APIs, AJAX and JSON. 

Users can use the input fields to enter a departure and destination on the Google Map to search for a car journey.  Then once the search button is clicked the website is going to look for any location within a 10 mile radius of both the departure and destination and return results of available car share opportunities.  Each result shows information about the trip itself as well as information about the driver, their name and a profile picture of the car. Also the departure and destination details are printed along with the date and time and either 'One-off journey' or 'Regular'.  Also you can see the price per seat and the number of seats available. If one of the results is clicked, an animated element reveals more information about the driver, including gender, telephone number and a description.  The telephone number is only available to those who login.

Once a user logs in, they are directed to 'My Trips' page where all trips are managed.  A trip can be added, edited or deleted.  When adding a trip, a departure and destination are selected and the Google Maps window draws the corresponding route.  The user then chooses how much to charge for the journey, how many seats are available and whether it's 'Regular' or 'One-off'.  If 'Regular' is chosen, days of the week will appear as checkboxes to select along with the time to be selected.  If 'One-off' is chosen, two fields will appear, one to choose the date and the other to select a time.  A trip can be edited to change any of the details or deleted entirely.
