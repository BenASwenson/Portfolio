Used CSS gradients to style the backgrounds of HTML elements.  Also, box shadows to add 3D effects to page.  And used transitions to add nice interactivity and the best user experience.  Also used nice Javascript functions to change inner HTML of elements.  And managed to show and hide elements.  And used nice functions to create timing events.
